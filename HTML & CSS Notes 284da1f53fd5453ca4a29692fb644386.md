# HTML & CSS Notes

- Language and tools of web development
    - Front end & back end are two parts of a website
    - Front end is the part with which you interact with and the back end is the part that powers the front end, it’s behind the scenes and it’s mainly about storing, databases and providing it to the front end.
- How websites work
    - key concepts e.g. **URL, HTTP, DOM**
        - URL : Uniform Resource Locator, it’s a way to locate a resource on the Internet
        - There are two pieces here the browser (**Client**) and the computers that host our target website (web server). It is called the client server model. The client requests a service, the server provides that service. So our browser sends a message to the server and says give the homepage of this website. This message is formatted based on a protocol called **HTTP** or **hypertext transfer protocol**.
        - **HTTP** is a language used by client and server to talk to each other, it’s not a programming language, it’s a plain textual language.
        - We also have **HTTPS** which is **HTTP** with **Encryption**
        - The server receives a message from the client, it figures out what the client is asking, and then it will send a message back to the client. **HTTP** Is a set of rules that clients and servers use to communicate and exchange data.
        - The message that the client sends to the server is called **HTTP request**. And the message that the server sends to the client is called **HTTP response**. The response contains different things e.g. the protocol used (HTTP/ 1.1) followed by status code (200 OK), type of content the server is sending back to the client e.g. text /html, after that there is the HTML code or the HTML document. As the browser reads the HTML document it constructs what we call a DOM, or document object model. It’s a model that represents the objects or elements in the HTML document. These elements are the **building blocks** of the page which include Headings, paragraphs of texts, images, links and other stuff. As the browser is reading the HTML document that is returned from the server, it discovers references to other resources in this document, like images, fonts and other stuff. Each of this resource has an address or a URL. So for each resource the browser sends a separate HTTP request in parallel to fetch that resource. Once the browser has all the necessary resources it will render the HTML document

- Basics of HTML
    - When we want to create a HTML document, we need to tell the browser that it’s a HTML 5 document or a HTML document. The way we do that is by using the tag <!DOCTYPE html>.
    - HTML is not a case sensitive language, which means it’s not sensitive to uppercase and lower case letters. The only thing in the Outer most tag is uppercase is DOCTYPE which is a convention, we can type it in lower case and it’ll still be fine.
    - Next we need to define the structure of the web page, so we’ll make use of the HTML elements. The first element we’ll use is the HTML element ***<html></html>***. Which is also the root element.
    - Most Html elements have an opening tag and a closing tag, but there are exceptions. We can also add other elements into an element e.g. we add the ***head*** element and the ***body*** element to the **html** element.
    - The head element is used to give the browser the information about the page e.g. in the head element we add the title element to specify the title of the page that appears on the pages’s tab.
    - The body element contains elements that will appear on the page. lets says we want to display a tweet, we’ll need two elements an image and some texts. Now the image element only has an opening tag and the reason that is so is because it can’t have any child elements. The image element has attributes e.g. src(source) and alt(alternative text), it’s alternative text if some image cant be displayed. The source attribute is used to specify the path or image. To add text we can make use of text element denoted by the tag **<p></p>.**
    - We can use attributes to provide additional information about an element(like the source of the image). Attributes are coded as part of the opening tag.
- Basics of CSS
    - To style an element using CSS, we write a **CSS rule** which consists of a **selector** and one or more **declarations.**
    - The selector is used to target one or more elements. We can select elements by their type, class, ID and so on.
    - There are three ways to write CSS
        - External CSS : Each Html page must include a reference to an external style sheet inside the **link** element. And the **link** element is inside the **head** element.
        - Internal CSS : An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the **<style>** element, inside the **head** element.
        - Inline CSS : may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline style, add the style attribute to the relevant element.
    - Here we’ll be using internal CSS. We use the **img** to reference the image element, then a pair of curly braces, and inside the braces we can write one or more CSS declarations.
    - Each **declaration** contains a **property** and a **value** e.g. width property and then it’s value in pixels and the declaration ends with a semicolon.
    - Because the picture had sharp edges, we use border-radius property to make the edges round and softer, and if you want to make the image circular shaped make the border radius half that of the width of the picture.
    - The picture and the text are stacked vertically and we want the image to be pushed on to the left side, so we’d make use of float property and give it a value of left, this will push the image element to the left side of the text elements.
    - Next the text was too close to the image, so we make use of margin-right, it will create a margin to the right of the image as a result it pushes the text to the right.
    - To style an element using CSS, we write a CSS rule which consists of a selector and one or more declarations
    - Next we need to make our text elements bold, for that we apply a rule to the paragraph element. In the rule we make use of font-weight property and assign it the value bold. This makes both our texts bold, but we only want the username in bold. For this we need to separate the two paragraph elements. What we’ll do is assign our paragraph element that contains the username an attribute called class. Now this paragraph element will have a different category from the other paragraph elements. Now whenever we need to define a rule for an element that belongs to a class, we use a dot then the name of the class followed by curly braces.

## Day 2 : HTML Basics

Trick : Enter exclamation mark and then press tab. This will give us basic HTML Boilerplate code, which a basic html template. 

### Head section

- Head section is used to give browser information about the web page.
- Head section has meta elements. We use the first meta element to define the character set. Meta element gives information about the web page to the browser. e.g. the first meta element is charset=”UTF-8”, it defines the character set. Computer don’t understand characters like ABC or 1, 2,3 or !,@,# and so on, computers understand numbers which are represented in the binary set like zeros and ones. So using a character set we can map a character to a numeric value. ASCII character set was also used but it only contains characters from English language, so it’s very limited. These days we use UTF-8 which represents all characters in the world.
- The next meta element configures the view port. The view port is the visible area of a web page. We need this element so that our web page looks good on all devices, mobile, tablet and desktop computers.

## Text element

- The most common element for working with text are <p></p>. Some times we want to emphasize some part of the text, for that we wrap that part of the text with <em></em> emphasize element. HTML is not meant for styling, it should only be used for structuring content.
- In HTML we have 6 heading elements h1 to h6. Heading 1 represents the most important headings and heading 6 represents the least important heading. These heading should not be chosen based on there size, because the size can always be changed with CSS. **We should use these heading to create a hierarchy**. So every web page must only have one H1 element, h1 represents what this page is all about.

## Entities

- Some characters are reserved in HTML and to display them we have to use a special notation.

```html
<body>
	<p> I love to use HTML</p>
</body>
```

- If I want to wrap the word HTML inside angle brackets

```html
<body>
	<p> I love to use <HTML></p>
</body>
```

- Here VS code will think we are adding an HTML element. And the word HTML will not be displayed on the browser. So to solve this problem we are going to use HTML entities. These entities start with a ampersand and end with a semicolon, and in between theses characters we type a few characters that determine the type of HTML entity. Entity that represents the less than sign is **lt** so we’ll write it as **&lt;** and the entity that represents the greater than sign is **gt** so we’ll type it as **&gt;**

```html
<body>
	<p> I love to use &lt;HTML&gt;</p>
</body>
```

- HTML entities can be found on google

## Hyperlinks

- Web pages have links to other pages or websites to create this link we use the **anchor** element.
- Every anchor element must have a href(hyper reference) attribute. As href we can either use a relative or an absolute URL. A relative URL starts from the current page. Currently we are on the index.html page and we want to go to about.html. And currently both these pages are in the same folder. So the URL we’ll enter will be relative. Now Where is about.html relative to the current page ? It’s in the company folder, so in href we’ll append the name of folder company before about.html.
- We have linked our index.html to another html documents, but we can also link it to images, PDFs, power points and so on.
- We can also link to other part of the same page. E.g. the CSS section is below the fold and we have to scroll down to see that part of the page. What we can do here is add a link to the CSS section on the top of the page. For this we will give our CSS section a unique identifier, every element on the page could have a unique identifier.
- we can also link to external websites. e.g. www.google.com. If we want the link to open up in a new tab instead of the same tab, we add an attribute **target** to the anchor element and give it a value “_blank”.

## Images

- Sizing images : we can use CSS to resize our images. In the head section we’ll add a style element and in there we’ll define a rule for our image. Now this rule is applied to all images on the page and this is probably not what we want to do in a real world scenario. In a real world scenario we want to apply a class to this element, and then define rules for that class.
- When we apply the rules to the image, it gets squashed. We have a new property in CSS called object fit. Most of the time we use the value cover, so the image covers it’s containing box. Conceptually there is a container around every element in an HTML document. We don’t see it

## Video

- To embed a video we need to use the video element.
- To add the control buttons, we need to add the attribute controls to the video element.
- Controls attribute is a boolean attribute, it doesn’t have a value but its presence means it true and its absence means its false.
- There another boolean attribute called autoplay, it’ll play the video automatically when the page gets loaded.
- To embed an audio we need to use the audio element, it also has the same attributes as video element.

## List

- There are 3 type of list elements.
- Unordered list **<ul></ul>** list is used most of the time. We use it whenever we have items in which order doesn’t matter. A common implementation of this is when you implement navigation menus on the Top of the page. But we can use unordered list for listing any type of objects, like images, products in shopping cart and so on.

```html
<ul>
    <li>About me</li>
    <li>Courses</li>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML 5</li>
        <li>CSS 3</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Subscribe</li>
    <li>Contact me</li>
  </ul>
```

- Ordered list <ol></ol> uses numbers.

```html
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven</li>
    <li>Place the ingredients on the crust</li>
    <li>Put the pizza in the oven</li>
  </ol>
```

- **Description list** <dl></dl> is used to implement glossaries or display metadata. e.g. we can have a **description term** and then a short **description detail** about that term.

```html
<dl>
    <dt>Title</dt>
    <dd>The ultimate HTML and CSS Courses</dd>
    <dt>Author</dt>
    <dd>Haider Ali</dd>
    <dt>Skills</dt>
    <dd>HTML</dd>
    <dd>CSS</dd>
    <dd>Responsive design</dd>
    <dd>Search engine optimisation</dd>
  </dl>
```

## Tables

- Table element should be used for tabular data only
- Tables have one or more rows. To define a row we use <tr></tr> element. In this element we can have one or more cells. Which can be data cells or header cells. Header cells are the top most cells that represent the column. And all the other cells are data cells.
- To define a header cell we use a Table header element <th></th>.
- To define a data cell we use a table data element <td></td>.
- If there is some element in the table that we want to customize, we can style it using CSS e.g. we have styled our tables, table headings, table rows and table data.
- If we have two CSS rule for two different elements that are the same we can use a comma to separate the rule and have only one rule it’s call DRY principle in SE. Don’t repeat yourself.

```html
<style>
    table, th, tr, td {
      border: 1px solid grey;
      padding: 5px;
      border-collapse: collapse;
    }
    
    
  </style>
```

- To make a table meaningful for search engines, we need to tell the search engine we have two sections, a header and a body. To do that we use <thead></thead> element and <tbody></tbody> elements. Then we move the first row into the <thead></thead> element. The same way we move the body of the table into the <tbody></tbody> elements. We get the same output as before but our markup is more meaningful to the search engine. This is called semantic HTML, semantic means meaningful.
- Optionally we can add a footer, so after the <tbody></tbody> element we add the <tfoot></tfoot> element.
- The element in the <th></th> elements have different style from the <td></td> elements. In the header cells our text is bold and aligned in the center in contrast in data cells text is aligned to the left. To align text in header cells to the left we can write a css rule for <tfoot> and <tf> in which we will have a declaration text-align: left.

## Containers

- Navigation bars have a logo, bunch of menu items, so the navigation bar is a container for these elements. Another example would be a hero unit. The hero unit has a background image, a heading, some text and a couple of links. The hero unit is a container for the these elements. Containers are used a lot in web pages.
- In HTML we have few different container elements. The one that is most commonly used is the <div></div> division element. This element doesn’t have any visual appearance.
- When you define a rule for a div element, it will apply on all the div elements on the page. And this is not what we want. So we give this div a class. Let’s say product. Then we change the selector from div to div.product. Now this rule will apply to all div with product class.
- div fills the entire width of the page but why does this happen. Div is a block level element. Block level elements start on a new line and fill up the entire available space. So if we duplicate this div, the new div will start on a new line.
- Another generic container element is called  the span element, which is often used for styling text. If we use div element around some text in a paragraph, that text will use the entire width of the page. But if we don’t want that effect we can span element instead of the div element.

## Semantic Elements

- div and spans are general purpose container element. But HTML 5 introduced more container elements that are more descriptive and meaningful. We refer to these as semantic elements. We should use these instead of the generic containers like div and span.
- Instead of using div we are using article element, which makes our markup more meaningful. e.g. we have product cards which can each be represented using article element instead of div element. In the article element we could have an image element, but if we place the image element inside a figure element it would make the markup more meaningful.
- Sometimes we want to highlight some texts, we learnt how to do that using the span element, but in HTML 5 we have an element for this purpose, its called the mark element <mark></mark>.
- Quite often articles have a published date and time. To make the date and time more semantic we make use of the time element <time></time>.

## Structuring a Web Page

- Every web page have three building blocks, a header, main and a footer. Sometimes we have a sidebar too for advertising. So after the main element we can have the aside element <aside></aside>.
- In the header we have a navigation bar with a list of menu items. We can have a navigation bar in the footer as well. In main element we have sections, and each section has a heading h2, we can also use an article element, with an article we can represent any independent, self contained piece of content. We can also have multiple article elements as well.
- Here we have multiple articles within a section, we can also have multiple sections within an article. It’s just a matter of how we choose to structure our web page.
- We use the main element to represent the main content of the page. And that means every page can have only one main element.
- We use the section element to group related content.
- We use the header element to represent introductory content which can belong to a page, a section or an article. The footer element can also be used in the same way.

## Day 3 : CSS Basics

## Providing CSS

- There are three ways to provide CSS.
    - Embedded style sheet
    - External style sheet
    - Inline styles
    
    Embedded style sheets
    
    - Are not scalable
    - Separation of concern: we want to have different modules for different concerns. We use HTML to structure our web pages and use CSS to style them. These are two different concerns and we should separate them. This is why we use external style sheets. We take all our styles inside the <style> element from the HTML document and put them in a separate file. Then we link our CSS file to our HTML doc by using the link element in the head element.
    - The link element has two important attributes, first one is rel or relationship which determines the type of resource we’re linking this document to, in this case a stylesheet, the second one is href or hyperreference here we need to provide a relative or absolute URL. We use relative URL when the Stylesheet is in the same place as the document we’re linking to and an absolute when the document we’re linking to in some other folder or place.
    - This link element is a self closing element
    - This doesn’t mean we should never use embedded styles, some times we want to overrides the styles that are defined in the style sheet. We can use the style element and define a new rule for the paragraph element, this new rule will override the rule in the styles.css

## Normalizing CSS

- Different browsers render different HTML elements differently. To address this issue we use a very popular style sheet called normalize.css. What this actually does is provide basic default styles for HTML elements so they exactly the same way across different browsers.

## Basic Selectors

- In css we have few different ways to select elements for styling purposes, we can select them by their type, ID, class and attribute.
- selecting with class

```css
//Selecting an element by Type
body {
	margin: 10px;
}
```

- Selecting with ID: when we use an ID to select an element, we use a pound sign # before we type the ID.

```css
// selecting an element by ID
#product {
	margin: 
}
```

- What’s the difference between ID and Class Attributes ?
- We cannot have multiple elements with the same ID, but we can have multiple elements with the same class.
- We can also select elements by their attributes, which is not as popular. To do that lets say we want to select all the anchor elements that have a target attribute

```css
a[target="_blank"]
```

- Select all the anchor by href attribute that have the value https://google.com. Here it looks for the exact match but code like this is often fragile. To make our code more flexible we can check for the existence of the word google, for this we prefix the equal to sign with an asterisk. We can also see if an attribute starts with a given value, for this we prefix equal to sign with carot sign. We can also see if some value ends with a given value, for this we prefix equal to sign with a dollar sign $. We can also combine multiple conditions by typing another square bracket and including a condition in it.

```css
a[href="https://google.com"] {
	color: orange;
}

a[href^="https"] {
	color: orange;
}

a[href]$=".com" {
	color: orange;
}

a[href^="https"][href$=".com"] {
	color: orange;
}

```

## Relational selectors

- We have selected elements using basic selectors e.g. type, ID and class. But we can also select elements based on relationship with other elements.
- Lets say we have a section with a paragraph in it and we want to style this paragraph, but not by using type, ID or class. Now the paragraph element is inside the section element. So we can start with the section element. We go to our style sheet and firstly select our ID and then select the paragraph element, so we are combining two selectors. It’s called relational selectors or to be more precise it’s called descendant selector. This rule will apply to any paragraph in the product section. e.g. if we have an article element within the product section and within article we have another paragraph, this paragraph too will be affected.

```html
<section id="products">
	<p>lorem ipsum dolor sity amet.<>
</section>
```

```css
#products p {
	color: blue;
}
```

- But what if we just want to style the first paragraph only, that is the direct child of the product section. For this we use a greater than sign between the two selectors.

```css
#products > p {
	color: blue;
}

```

- We have another relational selector for selecting siblings. Let’s say we want to style a paragraph which is a direct sibling of the section element, which means its right next to the section element. To do that we use the plus sign + between the two selectors. Now the third paragraph is blue only. Only the direct sibling will be blue, if we add another paragraph that wouldn’t be a direct sibling of the products section and the relations selectors wont effect it.
- But what if we want to style all paragraph elements that come after the products section, for this we need a tilde sign between the two selectors.
- Relational selectors help us write cleaner markup because we dont have to assign Id’s and classes to various HTML elements.
- There are two problems with Relational selectors that you need to be aware of, the first problem is that they can be fragile because they are dependent on the location of these elements in the DOM. So if you move elements around our styles will break. The second problem is that they are not as performant as basic selectors.

## Pseudo-class selectors

```html
<body>
  <article>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
  </article>
</body>
```

- We have an article element and in it we have two paragraphs, and we want to style the first paragraph only. We can assign the first paragraph with a class. Then go to our style sheet and define a rule for paragraphs with the class “first”. When we use class selectors it’s often a good practice to drop the element type. So if tomorrow, we change the type of this element to something else our rules will not break. Now this rule will apply to any element with the class of first. But what if we want this rule to apply to our article. Well we can apply the article element type to the paragraph selector e.g article.first {}. Now this is a basic way of doing this however the step where we assign a class to the first paragraph was unnecessary. We didn’t have to assign the paragraph element a class, because in CS, we have a bunch of pseudo classes that are automatically applied by the browser. Pseudo classes are not real classes, they are classes that browsers apply by default.
- So if we remove the class attribute from the paragraph element. And instead of using a real class we’ll use a pseudo class. These classes start with a colon and then we type first-child

```css
article.first {
	color: blue;
}
article:first-child {
	color: blue;
}
```

- We get the same result as before and we didn’t have to assign the article element with any class attribute.
- first-child is a pseudo class selector. But it is a little fragile. e.g.

```html
<body>
  <article>
    <h2>Heading</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
  </article>
</body>
```

Now the first paragraph is no longer styled, the style that we defined is now applied to the heading, because the heading is the first child of the article. If we move our elements around it may break our CSS rules. So another pseudo class selector called first-of-type, it is applied to first occurrence of element of different types in a container. If we use first-of-type both the heading and first paragraph will be styled according to the rule. But what if we want this rule first-of-type to be applied to the first paragraph only but not the heading, then we append p the element type before the colon. 

```css
article p:first-child {
	color: blue;
}
```

- Similarly we have two other type of selectors, last-child and last-of-type. But if we remove or add some elements our rules may break. e,.g if we had an anchor then the last child wont be the paragraph and it wont be bold, now the link is the last child which is also bold.
- Sometimes we want to style elements based on their position in a container, e.g. lets say we have a table or a list and we want to highlight all the odd items. We’ll go to the style sheet and select our unordered list, and then select list items that are odd and then we’ll use another sudo class selector that is nth-child. Now this selector is like a function and in between parentheses we can pass or an argument, so if we specify odd it will target all the odd items in our list.

```css
ul li:nth-child(odd) {
	color: blue;
}
```

## Pseudo-element selector

- Sometimes we want to style a part of an element, like the first letter or first line of a paragraph. This is where we use pseudo-element selectors. If we want to style the first letter of the paragraph we can wrap the first letter with span element. And then assign that span element with a class and then in our style sheet declare rules for elements of that class. But this is totally unnecessary, instead we can use pseudo-element selectors instead of a class. So what we do first is target the paragraphs then use double colons for pseudo elements followed by first-letter

```css
p::first-letter{
	font-size: 140%;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```

- We use pseudo-element to style part of an element and use pseudo-classes to style element in a particular state.
- We have another pseudo-element for inserting content before the content of an element. e.g. we have a paragraph and we want to insert something before the content of every paragraph on our page. In our style sheet we choose to target paragraph for which we type p and then two colons and then before and declare content and give it a property ‘…’. This pseudo element is not a real element, it will be inserted into the DOM

## Selectors Specificty

- Some times we end up in a situation where more than one rule can target a given element and these rules can have conflicting styles. So how does the browser determine which rule to apply ?
- This is where selector specificity comes to play. Each selector has what we call a specificity or a weight. If multiple rules target the same element, the browser will apply the rule that is more specific. ID selectors are most specific because we cant have two elements that can have the same ID so it is very specific, then we have class and attribute selectors these are less specific, because we can have multiple elements with the same class or attributes. At the next level we have element selectors because we can have many elements of the given type. So which selector do you think is more specific. It’s the class selector which is the most specific.
- Another way to target the h1 heading is to use the ID selector. We give our h1 heading an ID of products and then in our style sheet we declare a rule for ID products and set the color to green. Now this Id selector is the most specific selector and now our heading will be green. Now what if we have two selectors with equal specificity or equal weight, which rule will be applied ? Its’s the rule that comes last.
- How can we prevent a rule from over writing previous rules ? E.g. If we want a the heading h1 to remain dodgerblue. There are twl solutions here, one is to use the **important** keyword. So part of htis declaration, we type out an exclamation mark followed by the important keyword. When we apply this keyword other rules will be discarded. The important keyword must not be used as it is considered a bad practice, your CSS gets messy and its hard to maintain, you will end up fixing styling issue. A better solution will be, the reason our heading is brown is because of the third rule we applied on line 13, and it’s specificity is 100 and to make the heading blue, we have to write a rule that is more specific. The left most number “1” represents the number of ID selectors, the middle number represents the class/attribute selectors and the right most represents the element selectors. So the rule we want to write must have at least 1 ID selector, and additionally a class or an element selector. So we first select an element with the class of highlight and the ID of products .highlight#products and within it we declare a color dodgerblue and now the specificity is 110. What we can also do instead of selecting the class highlight is select the element heading h1, the selector h1 is more still more specific.

## Inheritance

- Some CSS properties by default inherit values from their parents. E.g. if we have a paragraph element within which we have a word wrapped up in a strong element. Now whatever color the paragraph’s text will be, the text in the strong element will also be the same, because the strong element is placed within the paragraph element, it will be a child of the paragraph element and it has inherited the color property.
- What if we don’t want our strong element to inherit this value, for this we need to declare a rule for the strong element and set the value of color to initial, this sets the color property to its default value.
- Not all properties are inherited, properties that change the font, font size, the vertical space between lines, the alignment of text, the color of the text, these are the properties that get inherited.

## Colors

- In CSS we have few different ways to represent colors e.g. Named colors, RGB, HSL and Hexadecimal.
- RGB is short for Red, green and blue.
- We can also represent this number using hexadecimal system. Hexadecimal is the one of the many numerical systems. We have a binary system that contains the numbers 0 and 1, then we have the decimal system which contains the numbers from 0 to 9. Hexadecimal is another system that contains the number from 0 to 9 and also the alphabets from a to f

## Gradient

- With gradients we can create beautiful transitions between two or more colors. Gradients are technically images, and to to set gradients we cannot use background color property, we can use background-image property or background property. To create the gradient we call the linear gradient function and pass two colors e.g. dodgerblue and yellow, we can also use Hexadecimal colors or RGB colors and so on.
- By default this transition is from top to bottom but we can easily change it. Our function linear-gradient() takes a first argument in which we supply the direction e.g. linear-gradient(to right, dodgerblue, yellow) now our gradient starts from the left and goes to the right. We can also target corners e.g. linear-gradient(to bottom right, dodger blue, yellow) now the gradient starts from the top left corner and ends goes to the bottom right.
- We can also supply a third color e.g. tomato      linear-gradient(to bottom right, dodger blue, yellow, tomato)
- This was linear gradient, but in CSS we have another type called radial gradient. To use radial gradient we call the radial-gradient( ) function, we pass it two colors e.g radiant-gradient(white, yellow)

## Borders

- The border property takes 3 values, the first value is the thickness of the border, the second value is the style of the border and the third value is the color. e.g. border(10px, solid, royalblue). This border property is a short hand property, it takes these values and applies them to borders on each side. But we have few other properties in CSS for defining the border on each side. e.g. we could use border-top: 20px solid royalblue;. Similarly we have a border left, border right and border bottom.
- we also have borders width property with which we can define the width of all borders. The first value we give it is the width of the top border, the second value is the width of the right border, the third value is the width of the bottom border and the forth value is the width of the left border. What if we remove the width of the left border the last value, in this case the browser uses the same value as the right border for the left border. What if you remove all values except the 1st one, then the browser will apply this width to all borders.
- We also have border styles, and we can supply different styles for top, right, bottom and left border.
- Another important property is border radius, with it me can make the borders round. If we have a square and we apply this rule to that then the square will become a circle if the the border radius property is 100%.

## Shadows

- In CSS we can easily add shadows around elements using the **box shadows property**. Here we have to supply a few values, the first value is the horizontal distance of the shadow to the element, if we use a positive value here it will move the shadow to the right. And if we use a negative value it will move the shadow to the left. The second value is the vertical distance from the shadow to the element. If we use a positive value it will move the shadow down and if we use a negative value it will move the shadow up. If we want to choose the color of the shadow we can provide that too.
- If you wan to make this shadow a little bit softer, here we can supply a third value to determine how much we want to soften or blur the shadow. let’s go with 10px
- Because we provided it a value of 10px to move to the shadow to the right and then 10px again to move it down and because of that the shadow doesn’t cover the top and left of the box and we want it to be spread evenly. So what we’ll do is supply it with two 0px values for the horizontal and vertical distance, this will place the shadow right under the box and with this blur we’ll see very nice shadow around the box.

# Advanced HTML and CSS concepts

## Layouts: size and position elements on the screen

### The Box Model

- One of the most important concepts of CSS is the BOX Model. Which means **whenever browser render an element, it puts that element inside an invisible box**. At the core of this box we have the content area. This is where our content is displayed. so if you have a paragraph element with some text, our text is shown here. Outside of the content area we have the padding area, which is used for adding some space outside of the content area. Next, we have the border area, and if you have a border, the border is shown here. And finally, we have the margin area, which is used to add some space in between different elements.
- technically we should use the margin property to separate elements and the padding property to add space between border and the content area of an element. This is the right way to use these properties

### Sizing Elements

- We gave the box a width and height of 100px so the size of the box is 100px * 100px. If we apply padding or border to our box it is going to get bigger. e.g. if we apply a padding of 20px and a border of 10px solid orange our box is going to get bigger, becasue by default the width and height property are applied to the content box. So any padding or border we apply will increase the size of the visible box. The actual size of the box now is 160px *160px. By looking at the legend, we have a left border of 10px, a left padding of 20px, the content area is 100px, a right padding of 20px and right border of 10px that sums up to 160px So this is what you need to take away. By default the width and height properties are applied to the content box. And any padding or border we apply will increase the size of the visible box. The margin property will not increase the size of the visible box. It will just move this box away from other boxes. If we give it a margin of 50px our box will move position but the size will remain the same.
- Calculating the actual size of an element is a little complex. We don’t want to go through this hassle all the time. So this is where the box-sizing property comes to the rescue. By default this property is set to content-box the reason we have this weird behavior but if we set it to border-box, the size that we apply here will be applied to the border box. Now our box will be 100px by 100px, according to the legend we have 10px border left, 20px left padding, these values are subtracted from the width of 100px. That is why our content area is now reduced to 40 px, and now if you remove the border and padding properties our box is still 100px by 100px. And in this case the content area is now 100px by 100px. So the conclusion is by applying the box-sizing property calculating the size of the element becomes easier and more predictable.  But there is a problem here, we dont want to apply this property to every single HTML Element. We dont want to repeat this. So this is where we can use universal selector. So on the top we can use the universal selector to select all HTML elements. Universal selector can have performance implications. Most of the time we use universal selectors to select all elements and set their box sizing property to border box. But there is one problem the universal rule does not apply to pseudo element. Like the before and after elements. If we insert pseudo element to our DOM, this rule will not apply to that pseudo element. We define a new rule box::before, so we are going to insert something before the content of our box e.g. “Hello  ”. Now if we examine the pseudo element, it is using the default box sizing that is content box. So to solve this issue, we need to extend this rule we need to change our universal selector from * {} to *, *::before, *::after{}. this will include all elements, all elements before and all elements after.
- The width and height property are only applied to block level elements. Block level elements are inserted on a new line and they take up the entire available horizontal space. So look at our box, it is 100px by 100px but it is taking up the entire available horizontal space. And if insert another box, this new box is inserted on a new line. So div’s are block level elements. Now lets replace this div’s with span. As a result what happened here, the inline elements don’t respect the width and height properties. But what if you have an inline element and be able to give it a width and a height. For this purpose we have the display property. For span or inline elements in general, this property is set to inline by default, for div’s it’s set to block but we have a third value here called inline-block, this is a combination of inline and block elements, just like block level elements we can give them a width and a height. And just like inline elements, these elements are not inserted on a new line. So we are going to have two boxes laid out horizontally next to each other. But these boxes will have a dimension. In case your wondering why we have some space between the two boxes, is because when we put our cursor at the end of the first span statement and press the right arrow key we have a few spaces in between the two span statements
- Summary: Using the width and height properties we can set the size of elements. But by default the sizes are applied to the content box which can get a bit complicated. So using the box sizing property, we tell the browsers that the size should be applied to the border box. Now we dont want to apply this declaration for every single element so this is where we use the universal selector to target all HTML elements. And inline elements don’t respect width and height, so to be able to give them a width and a height we must set their display property to inline-block.

### Overflowing

- An important concept related to fixed sized elements is that sometimes overflow may happen. So we might have a container with a fixed size. And we might have too much content inside this container. So the container cannot fit the entire content. That is when overflow happens.
- We have a box with a width and height of 150 px  and in this box we have a long paragraph. This text is overflowing from the box. What we can do is use the overflow property to decide how overflow should behave. overflows default value is visible but if we set it to hidden the extra content will be hidden. Another possible value is scroll. When we use this we see two scroll bars, a horizontal and a vertical one.

### Measurement Units

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

body {
  
}

.box {
  width: 15rem;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: yellow;
  border-top: 3px solid orange;

```

- so far we have used pixels to size elements.
- There are two categories in which units of measurement fall. E.g. Absolute and Relative
- Absolute units are always fixed e.g. pixels(px), points(pt), inch(in), centimeter(cm), millimeter(mm). Only px is used in web the other three are used in printing only.
- Relative units are relative to something else. e.g. we have percentages that are relative to the size of the parent element, we have VW and VH which are relative to the size of viewport, and em and REM which are relative to the font size. What you need to use depends on what problem your trying to solve.
- Lets create a div with class box and give that box a height and width of 100px and background color of gold. The size of the box is always the same no matter how big the screen is. So if we view this page on a mobile device or a tablet or a laptop our box is going to stay at the same size. For this reason some people argue that we should never use pixels because they are not scalable. We cannot use them to create web pages that are responsive to screen sizes. This is something to disagree with, pixels do have application. E.g if we give our box a top border about 3px solid orange. I want this border to be the same size no matter how big the screen size is. So If you view this border on a wide screen, you dont want this border to be really thick. I want it to be always 3px tall. So this is one application of pixel values.
- Relative values: lets change the width value to 50%, that means 50% of the value of the parent element. The parent of this element is the body element. The body element doesn’t have a width, but if we give it a width of about 300px. Now if we inspect our box we’d find out that our box is 150px. So all these relative values get converted to pixel values by the browser. what if we remove the width of the body element, so what will be the default width of the element, div is a block level element. And by default the width of the block level element is 100%. So our body element takes up 100% of the width of the page, and our box takes up half of the page. Now the interesting part is that if we resize the page our box also get resized. This is the benefit of using relative units. With relative units we can create layouts that adjust to the screen sizes. with relative units we can create more scalable layouts.
- Now lets say you want this box to take up the entire available vertical space and lets say you set the height to 100%. But due to this our box is not visible anymore, the reason is that by default the width of block level elements is 100% and the height is 0, but if we add some content inside these elements there height will increase to fit the content. so if we type hello inside our second div the height of the div will increase from 0 to 18px so we can see the word Hello.
- The problem is, we are saying the height of this box should be 100% of the height of it’s parent element. Now the parent element which is the body element doesn’t have a height property. So by default, it’s height is going to be 0. Now in this specific example, the only absolute unit we are using is for the border top property which is 3px, so the height of the body element will increase to 3 px and that is the reason why we see the border but not the box. So how can we make the box take up the entire vertical space, this is where we use View port units (vh), with this unit we can size our elements according to the width or height of the viewport. So we will replace the unit of box class from % to vh which is view port height. So this means now the height of the box class will be 100% of the height of the view port height. And if we resize our browser window, our box also resizes, that’s similar to vw which is short for view port width. So 50vw means 50% of the width of the width of the view port.
- We have two other relative units em and rem which are relative to the font size. We use these units when we want to adjust the layout according to the font size. So if the font becomes bigger we want the width to increase as well. So if we set the width to 10 em. 10 em means 10 times the font size of the current element. The current element box doesn’t have a font size, so it’s going to inherit the font size property from the parent element, which is the body element, the body element doesn’t have a font size property so it’s going to inherit it from it’s parent element which is the html element, html element has a default font size of property of 16 px. So it means 10 x 16 px which means 160px. so in this case our box element inherited the font property of the body element which is the root element. This is how the em unit works. But there is a problem with this unit if we don’t have an explicit font size on this element, we have to trace up the inheritance hierarchy to figure out what font size will be applicable. Sometimes it can get complicated so we have another font unit called rem. so if we change the font size from em to rem, that means 10 times the font size of the root element. Root element is html element and by default it is 16 px. So there is only one number we have to remember to calculate the actual length, we dont have to calculate the actual length, or we dont have to walk up the entire inheritance hierarchy. Now what if we change the width to 15 rem that means 15 times the 16 pixels, now the calculation has got a little complex, for this we have a little trick. On top, we can define a rule for the html element and set its font-size to 62.5%. That means 62.5% of 16 px which is 10 px. So that means whenever we see a value of 15 rem, we can assume it is equivalent to 150 px.
- Summary:  In our final code we are using three different units rem, vh and pixels. So there is no such thing as a best unit. What unit you use depends on what problem your trying to solve. We use pixels to have a fixed sized border, we use vh so that our box takes the entire available space vertically and used rem so that the width of the box adjusts based on the default font size.

### Positioning

- Firstly we create a div with the class boxes with a border of 3 px solid lighgrey, then within this div we create three more divs with the class box that has a width and height of 5 rem, here we are using rem unit that is relative to the font size of the root element. Because we want to give each box a different color, we’ll create three more classes box-one, box-two and box-three and assign back-ground color to these classes. Then we assign our div element multiple classes separated by space.
- In this lesson we are using abstract boxes but in a real scenario, these boxes could be anything, you could have images, headings, paragraphs, any kind of element, that is irrelevant. What we want to talk about is positioning.
- lets say we want to position the orange box a little bit to the right. This is where we use the position property. By default the position of all elements are static that means they are not positioned, they appear in their normal position.  To position our element first me must change our position property to relative, so that we could position this element relative to it’s normal position. Now using properties like top, bottom, right and left, we can move this box around. If we use left: 5 rem, we are going to add 5 rems of space on the left side of the box and it will push the box to the right side, if we use left: -5rem, it’ll move the box to the left side. We also have the right property, and if we set it to 5 rem it will add 5 rems of space to the right of the box and that’ll push the box towards the left.
- On web pages we have three axes. The horizontal axis which is also called the x-axis, the vertical axis, which is also called the y-axis and the z-axis which represents depth. You can think of it as a line that comes from your screen to your eyes. By default the z index property is set to zero. If we set it to a positive value, this element moves closer to us. If we set it to a negative value, it moves away from us. When we set z-index to a positive value its on top of the yellow box, but when we set it to a negative value our orange box is behind the yellow box.
- So with relative positioning we can move an element relative to its normal position and this does not impact the other elements.
- Now in contrast to relative positioning we have absolute positioning. With absolute positioning we can position an element relative to it’s container. First you have to go to that container and set it’s position property to relative. So now our orange box is positioned relative to it’s container, it is at the bottom right of the container. The important part is that the blue box moved up, but previously the orange box was here, and the blue box was right below. But now that we are absolutely positioning the orange box, the blue box moved up because when we absolutely position an element, that element is removed from the normal flow of the page, which means from the parents point of view, that element doesn’t exist, we can imagine it on a separate layer. So our container only sees two boxes the yellow and dodge blue.
- when we absolutely position an element, that element is removed from the normal flow of the page. And all the other elements are rendered as if the absolute position element doesn’t exist.
- So to recap, with absolute positioning we can position an element relative to it’s container. And for this to happen the container must be positioned relative.
- Some times we want to position an element relative to the view port, for example, we want to have a navigation bar that always stays on the top. So back to the second box lets set the position to fixed. We don’t the bottom and right property any more, so we’ll get rid of them. And we’ll use top: 0, And now if we pay attention to the orange box, its positioned outside of our container, because its position is relative to the view port, which is the visible area of the browser, so this element will always stay on on top even if we scroll down. To demonstrate this we are going to give our body the height of 200 vh, that is 200 % height of the view port and that makes our page longer. So now that we scroll down our orange box stay fixed at the top.
- There are two ways to set the size of positioned element, one way is to set the width and height properties, and the other way is to use the combination of left and right or top and bottom. For example, for the orange box, lets set left and right to 2 rem, that means we’re adding 2 rem of space to the right of the box and the left of the box. And if we notice the orange box, nothing has happened to it, because we have explicitly given our box class a width and height of 5 rem. But what we can do is set the width of the orange box to auto and let the browser decide how wide this box should be. Now the orange box will fill the entire width of the browser but will have 2 rem of space at right and left.
- Summary
    - Relative: With relative positioning we can position our element relative to it’s normal position. The other elements are not affected.
    - With absolute positioning we can position an element relative to its positioned container. That’s why we have to apply a relative position to its container.
    - With fixed positioning we can position an element relative to the view port.
    

### Floating Elements

- Floating elements is another technique for positioning elements and creating layouts.
- lets say we want to display a tweet, so what html element can we use to represent a tweet, we can use an article element, because with an article element we can represent any independent, self contained piece of content. So here we are using relative unit so if the default text size changes, our image also resizes accordingly. Our paragraph element is appearing on a new line, because paragraph are block level elements. And as you know block level elements begin on a new line. Now, to put this paragraph next to the avatar, we’re going to use the float property and set it to left, this will float the avatar element to the left side of its container and as result all the subsequent elements will float around it. So now our avatar element is pushed to the left side of its container which is the tweet, and our paragraph element is floating around it. Now if we add another paragraph with about 50 words, now this text too is flowing around the avatar. This is how floats work. Now currently our text is so close to the avatar, so we either apply a left margin to the paragraph or a right margin to the avatar.  Now there are situation where we dont want the second element e.g. the second paragraph to float around the the floated element. Maybe we have a link, an icon for like the tweet or for retweeting it. We want all these icons to appear right below the tweet. So how can we push this second paragraph below the avatar. This is where we use the clear property. So here we’re going to define a new class called clear or we could call it anything the name doesn’t matter and we set the clear property to left because we have an element that is floated to the left, if our element was floated to the right we had to set the clear property to the right. We will apply this property to the element we want to move e.g. here we want to move the 2nd paragraph below the avatar. Now there another value, called both and we could set the clear property to both, but when you have elements that are floated to the left or to the right, this will clear all of those floats. In fact a lot of people set it to both as this way we dont have to remember the direction of floats.
- Now there is a problem with float, which is that parent elements don’t see floated elements. E.g. if we write a rule for the tweet element and in it we give it a border of 3px solid grey. Now if we remove the second paragraph. Our parent element which is the article element with the class of tweet has collapsed. Now it only contains the first paragraph element so it’s not containing the avatar, because avatar is a floated element. And by default parent element don’t see floated elements. And if we remove the first paragraph element our parent element will collapse even more. So how do we overcome this problem. One way to solve this problem is to put an empty div at the end of this container to clear the float. So whenever we use float we have to clear after otherwise we run into weird layout issues. So this is one way, but there is a problem with this approach. This div in the end is not descriptive or meaningful or descriptive to search engines and screen readers because we have purely added this div to solve a layout issue. So our HTML markup is not semantic. The other way is to use pseudo-elements. Earlier we talked about before and after pseudo-elements. With this pseudo-elements we can add content before and after the content of an element. So we remove this div with class clear and write a new rule in our style sheet.
- So we want to add an element after the content of the tweet element. We will set the content property to just a pair of quotes, so this element is by default inline element, so here we have to use the display property  to convert it into a block level element. And then we set clear to both. So with this code we adding that div dynamically without polluting our markup with non-semantic elements.
- Now what if we had used a floated element somewhere else on this page, but outside of this tweet. Let’s say we have an element for displaying advertisement. So might have a class called ad and to solve the floating issue, we would have to use after pseudo-element selector one more time,and repeat all these styles. This is bad, we don’t want duplication in our code. So what we can do here is we rename this pseudo-element selector .tweet::after to something more general, more reusable, we can call this clear or clearfix.
- Now there’s a third way to fix this floating issue, we could use overflow property

### Flex Box

- Flex box means flexible box layout, or laying out elements in one direction.
- It’s a method for laying out elements in one direction like in a row or a column. It’s a lot easier and more powerful than floats.
- We’ll create a div with class container and then three divs within that div with class box labelled A, B and C.
- We’ll give a border of 3 px solid grey to our container class, and to our box class a width and height of 5 rem, back ground color of gold, and a margin of 1 rem.
- After this we get three boxes laid out vertically. Now what if you want to lay this out horizontally, that’s where we use flex. A common application of this is navigation bars. Because in navigation bars, we have a bunch of menu items or hyperlinks laid out horizontally. So the first step is go to our container class and enable flex, that is set the display property to flex. We can control the direction of the elements by using the flex-direction property, the default value is row, that is why our boxes are laid out in a row, but we can set this to column. This is about direction. The next thing to talk about is alignment.
- To align items, you need to understand the concept of Axes in flex. In flex we have two axes, the main (primary) axes and the cross (secondary) axes. These axes are dependent on the direction. So if we set the direction to row the main axis is going to be the horizontal axis and the cross axis is going to be the vertical axis. In contrast if we set the direction to column, the main axis is going to be the vertical axis and the cross axis is going to be the horizontal axis.
- Using these axis we can easily align items inside there containers. To align items there are two properties you need to remember justify-content and align-items. We use justify-content to align items along the main or the primary axis. And we use the align-items property to align items along the cross axis or the secondary axis.
- In our case, we have set the flex direction to row, so our horizontal axis is going to be primary axis or main axis and we should use justify-content property. Now justify-content has many different values but the default value is flex-start(our items will be aligned from where the flex starts), other values are flex-end(items are pushed to the end of the horizontal axis),  we also have center(items are centered), we can also distribute items along the horizontal axis, then we have spaced-evenly which distributes our items with equal spacing between them, we also have space-between (first and last item are pushed to the end of the horizontal axis and the other items are distributed with equal space between them).
- We have justified content horizontally, now we should align items vertically along the secondary axis, the default value is flex-start just like before, but we can set it to flex-end to push these items to the end of the vertical axis. Now in this case nothing happened because there is not enough space in our container. Our container is not tall enough to fit these boxes and that brings us to another important concept in flex. Even though we set display property to flex but this container is still a block level element. So by default it get tall enough to fit it’s children. So on the outside this element is block level element. But on the inside, it is behaves according to the flex box rules. So to align items vertically first we have to give this container some height e.g. 90vh that is 90% of the viewport height. So now we have a lot of space here and our boxes are pushed to the end of the vertical axis. With flex it’s so easy to put an element at the center of a container. This wasn’t very easy in the past, but with flex, all we have to do is to set these some properties like display, flex-direction, justify-content and align-items.
- So we have covered justify content and align items but what about align content, this property only works if we have multiple lines in our container. Currently we have a single line but lets add a few more boxes to create a second line. When we add more boxes, they appear on the same line and if we add even more boxes then the box size get smaller so that more boxes can be fit on that same line. This is the default behavior of the flex container. We can change this behavior by using the flex wrap property. So here is our container, we set flex-wrap property to wrap, by default it’s value is nowrap the reason why items fit on one line. When change it to wrap, the item keep their original size and any additional items that cannot fit on one line wrap on to second line. Earlier when we had a single line we put our element in the center of the vertical axis , but now that we have multiple lines our elements are not quite in the center, this is where align-content property comes into play, with this property we can align multiple lines or the entire content as a whole, so we put the entire content on the center of the vertical axis and with this we get a beautiful layout.
- Next we have three items, we want to position the first item on the top, this is where we use align-self property. So align-self is a property we apply on a flex item and not on the flex container. With this we can over ride the value we assigned earlier using the align-item property in our container class. so we set align-self property to flex-start. Now lets remove this line “align-self” we don’t need it anymore.
- We’ve practiced aligning elements, lets practice sizing elements. There are few properties we need to remember, one is flex-basis (the initial size of a flex item), we have flex-grow ( for setting the growth factor), flex-shrink (for setting the shrink factor), and flex property which is a short hand property which combines all three above properties. All these properties should be applied on flex items not flex containers.
- We can use flex-basis property to set the initial size of our boxes. By default it is set to auto, which means the browser is going to look at the width property. So if we set it to 10rem, this is going to override the width property and our boxes are going to be bigger in width. The reason this is happening is because we have set the flex-direction to row. So flex-basis translates to the width property. If we set the direction of flex to column, flex-basis will translate to height. Now we can apply this property to individual items as well e.g. in the class box-one we can set the flex-basis to 5 rem. So now our first box is smaller, lets erase this line because we don’t need it anymore and set our flex-basis in the class box to 5 rem.
- The second property is flex-grow, which determines the growth factor of our flex items. So currently our boxes are 5 rems, we have plenty of extra space available, with flex-grow we can allow these items to grow and take up the available space. So by default flex-grow is set to zero that is why our boxes are not growing. But if we set it 1, all these boxes will be growing at the same factor, we can change the growth factor for one or more boxes. E.g. we can set the flex-growth for box-one to zero and this prevents the first box from growing and all the available space is allocated to 2nd and 3rd boxes. We can change this to 2, and we can see that  the first two boxes have grown more than the other two boxes. Now you might be wondering why box one is not twice as bigger than other two boxes. Well this is a common misconception about flex-grow property. Just because we set the flex grow property to 2 that doesn’t mean this box is going to be twice as wide as the other two boxes. lets me explain how growing works, when we set the flex growth property the browser is going to look at the growth factor of each of these boxes. For the first box growth factor is 2, and for the other two the growth factor is 1. So 2 + 1 +1 = 4. So the browser is going to take up the entire available space divide it by four, then it;s going to allocate 2 portions to box-one, 1 portion to box-two and box-three.
- We have another property called flex-shrink, which is the exact opposite of flex-grow. It tells browser how these elements should shrink if there is not enough space to fit in the container. For this demo i’m going to change the initil size of boxes to 15 rem from 5 rem. and set flex-shrink to 1 which is the default value. So our boxes are bigger but if we resize the browser window, they’re shrinking at the same rate. Back to box-one, here we set the flex-shrink to 0 to prevent it from shrinking, the first box has a size of 15 rems which is maintaining it’s size where as other boxes have shrunk.
- Now we have a flex property which is a short hand for these properties. If we supply it a single value that is going to be used for the flex-grow property, if we supply it two values the 2nd value can be flex-shrink or flex-basis. But if we supply it 3 values the 1st is going to be flex-grow, the 2nd is going to be flex-shrink and third is going to be flex-basis.
- flex-grow and flex-shrink don’t have any units but only have a number.

### Grid

- So we saw that a flex box makes it easy to lay out elements in a row or a column. But sometimes we need to layout elements in both rows and columns, that’s why we use grids. A common application of grid is creating photo galleries. Or another example would be a typical layout for most web sites we have header on the top a sidebar on the left, a content area on the right and a footer in the bottom, and we can use a grid to lay out building blocks.
- To define a grid, first we need a container. On the container we going to set the display property to grid. And then we are going to use grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties to define the number and size of rows and columns. So we want to create a grid with 3 Rows and 2 columns. To define the rows we use grid-template-rows and set its value to 100px 100px 100px, number of values represent number of rows in the grid and each value represents the height of the respective row. To define two columns we use the property grid-template-column and set its value to 100px 100px, that means two columns with height 100px. Then we apply a border of 3px solid lightgray so that we can easily see what is going on.
- Now we don’t want duplication in our code and tomorrow if we decide to change the rows or columns there are multiple  places where we’ll have to modify, a better approach will be to use the repeat function, it takes two arguments, the first argument is the number of rows or columns we want to create and the second argument is the size of the rows or columns we want to create.
- Now lets add a bunch of items in our gird. E.g some abstract boxes. Then we are going to style the boxes e.g. give them a height and width of 5 rem and a background of Gold. The boxes are automatically placed from top left to bottom right. But we have full control over the placement of these items.
- now lets talk about alignment, firstly we’ll toggle the grid overlay. Each box or grid item is aligned to the top left of it’s containing cell. But we can easily align these items along the horizontal and vertical boxes. So here we have two properties, justify-items for aligning items along the horizontal axis, and align-items for aligning item along the vertical axis. These properties are similar to the properties we had in flex box, but in flex instead of justify items we have justify content. In grid we do have justify content but most of the time we use justify items and align items.
- So now we want to align our boxes along the horizontal axis. So we’ll use justify-item property and set it to center, now each box or item is in the center of the horizontal axis. Now we want to align the items vertically so we’ll use align-item property to align them vertically. Now each box is in the center of it’s cell.
- If we want to align the grid inside it’s container we have two properties for that. We have justify-content property which we set to center for horizontal alignment and align-content for vertical alignment which we set to center, but no visible difference is seen because the container has grown tall enough to fit the grid, there is no extra vertical space. what we can do is add a new property to our container to have a height of 100vh or 100 % of the view port height. So now we have some space at the top and the bottom and our grid is perfectly centered inside this container. For simplicity we’ll remove the grid alignment properties e.g. justify-content and align-content.
- The default values of justify-item and align-item is stretch, and if we set it to that value nothing happens, the reason is that we have explicitly set the value of width and height on our boxes. So if i remove the width property, our box is gonna stretch horizontally to fill it’s containing cell. Now similarly if we remove the height property the box is going to stretch vertically to fill it’s containing cell.
- Stretch is the default property for justify-items and align-items, but we don’t need to explicitly set these properties, so we’ll get rid of them.
- Next we want to get rid of the absolute values e.g. number of rows and their size because we don’t our boxes to take the entire space of their respective containers. We want the first column to take 30 % of the space and the second column to take 70 % of the space. So in the place where we mentioned we want 2 columns of width 100 px, we would instead mention 30% 70%, so the first column will take 30% of the total width and the second column will take 70% of the total width. However percentages are little bit tricky when working with grids because of we had another column here with absolute length of 100 px, Our grid will grow larger than it’s container, because percentage is based percentage is based on the width of the container. So what we need here is the percentage of the available free space. So after we allocate 100 px for the first column, we have some free space left in the container, we want 30% of the free space not 30% of the width of the container. So there is another unit called “fr” that comes into play which means a fraction of the available space. So as a best practice prefer fractions instead of percentages when setting sizes of rows and columns.
- Now we are going to change the rows as well, we want three rows. Our first row is going to be 100 px, we want the second row which is the container of the side bar and the main content to grow and fill the entire space so here we use the auto keyword, and for the footer we can use 100 px as well. Now if we resize the window, we’ll see that the second row is being resized while the first and last row keep their absolute length which is 100 px.
- Currently our grid cells are right next to each other, but we can apply a gap between our rows and columns. For this we have three properties row gap, column gap and gap(which is short for the first two properties). So we apply row gap and column gap to 10px.
- Now lets talk about placing items. For this we have three properties, grid-row, grid-column and grid-area(which is short for grid-row and grid-column). By setting these properties on an item we can control exactly where that item must be placed. Lets say want the first item to take the entire first row. So we go to our markup and give an extra class e.g. box-one and define a rule for it in the style sheet, so for box one that is box A we set the grid-column to 2, so because of this the first item moved to the second column and the other items are automatically placed from top left to bottom right, but now lets move it back to the 1st column.
- By default each item takes one cell, but if you want an item to take more than one cell, here, we type a forward slash, and then type the end line number. So go to the inspect/ dev tools and toggle the grid icon to show the line numbers. so we want the first item which is item A to start from line-1 and end at line-3. So we can also count backward that is -1 means the last column, so instead of using 1 / 3 we could use 1 / -1. We can also use span keyword after the forward slash to specify the number of cells this cell is going to take e.g grid-column: 1 / span 2; this will have the same effect as using grid-coulmn: 1 / 3; or grid-column: 1 / -1.
- similarly we have another property called grid-row, we can move this box-one to second row using grid-row: 2; So the item A is moved in the second row in place of box B and C, and Box B and C are automatically places from top left to bottom right. Similarly we can say this box starts from row 2 and go up to row 4. Okay now lets move it back to first row, we dont need to explicitly set this because by default this item is placed on the first row
- Another way of placing items is by defining specific areas in our grid and then placing those items in those areas. We have two properties for doing this, we set grid-template-areas on our container to define the areas. And then on individual items, we set grid-area to a particular area. so back to our container we use grid-template-areas and set it to empty quotes, that represents the template for the first row. In the first row we are going to have two cells and we can give each cell a name e.g. “header header”, the first cell’s name is header and the 2nd cell’s name is also header. After this we type another pair of quotes and type the name of the cells in the second row e.g. “”sidebar main” that means that the first cell in 2nd row is called sidebar and the second cell in the 2nd row is called main. And for the last row we will type another pair of quotes and type “footer and footer”. So we have defined a few different areas header, sidebar, main and footer. Now we can put the first box in the header area. So in the box-one class we set the grid-area to header and remember not to use quotes here. So earlier we used grid-column inside box-one class to tell that our box-one starts from grid’s column line 1 and ends at  grid column line 3 that is a total of two columns. but instead now we can use grid-area property and set it to header and we’ll get the same result as before

### Hiding Elements

- Lets define two paragraphs and then hide the second. Lets give our first paragraph a class. And then define a rule for the class first. We have two properties for hiding an element and it’s really important to understand their differences. The first property is called display and if we set it to none, the first paragraph disappears. And the second paragraph is displayed on the top.
- The other property to hide elements is visibility property, the default property is visible, but if we set it to hidden, the first paragraph is not there anymore but its space is still allocated. That’s why the second paragraph is still in its place.

### Media Queries

- With media queries we can provide different styles for different devices, depending on their features such as screen size, orientation and so on. So with this we can build web pages that look great on mobile phones, tablets and desktop computers. We call this web site responsive web site, because they respond to various screen sizes. Now to built responsive web sites we have two approaches, we can built a desktop version first, then adjust the layout for tablets and mobiles. Or we can start with mobile first and then adjust the layout for tablets and desktops. Different people have different preferences here but the majority of community favors mobile first because it’s a lot simpler to built a simple web page for mobile. And then if you have extra space we can add extra stuff. On the other hand if we build a complex page for desktop, then we’ll have to squeeze a lot of things so that the page looks mobile. It’s definitely doable, but it’s not something that i recommend. So here we are going to take the mobile first approach.
- So we are going to build two boxes that are side by side or next to each other but on mobile they are going to get stacked vertically. So lets see how we can use media queries to implement something like this. So to implement this we are going to use flex on this container. By default flex direction is set to row, so for mobile we are going to set flex direction to column and then we use media queries to see if the screen is wider than let’s say 500 pixels and then we are going to set the flex direction to row. So these boxes will appear next to each other.
- We’ll start of with a div with the class of container and inside the div we are going to have two div with the class of box. Inside each div with class of box we are going to have a paragraph with some dummy text. So to implement this we are going to use flex on this container. So for mobile you are going to set flex direction to column. And then use media queries to see if the screen is let’s say 500 pixels, then we are going to set the flex-direction to row. So these boxes will appear next to each other.
- For our container class we are going to set the display property to flex and set the flex-direction to column. So this is the mobile first approach. We are starting on mobile and make sure everything looks great on mobile and then we are going to adjust styles for larger screens, tablet and desktops.
- For our boxes we are going to set our background to gold and add some padding so that the text is not so close to the edges of the box. Next we want our other box to be red so here we’ll use pseudo-class selector, nth-of-type(2), so this would target the second occurrence of an element with the class of box.
- So here’s what we are going to do, first we are going to make the browser window really small, like on a mobile phone. Now start increasing our browser window size and look at our design. At some point our design is going to break, it’s going to look bad. That is the moment you need a break point. So a break point is a point at which our design breaks down. We’re going to use media queries to write specific styles for devices that are wider than our break point. So lets say the break point is at when the view port is 550 pixels wide, and that’s the point when we want to put our boxes next to each other. So we go to our style sheet, and write a media query, so we start of by typing @media and then we type our query, a query can have multiple parts, so with each part they are asking something about the target device. The first part is the type of the device, screen, or web browser or print. Print targets printer, but right now we are going to use screen. Next you want to type the second part of the query, so we use the AND operator and a pair of parentheses in which we type a condition, we want to check to see if the screen is wider than 550 pixels, so we type miin-width: 550px. So if this query is true the styes defined in the curly braces will be applied, otherwise they are going to be ignored. So If the query is true, the new rules that we define here will override the previous rules, for example for our container we are going to change our flex direction to row. So When the break point occurs our boxes are laid out horizontally. Our query can have multiple parts so we can extend this query and check the maximum width of the device as well e.g. max-width: 900px, now the defined rules will be applied when the screen size is larger than 550px and smaller than 900px. Now lets remove the last condition of max-width: 900px and write an new rule for screen sizes of 900px.

## Typography

### Styling Fonts

- Three categories of fonts Serif, San-serif, Monospace
- Serif font has small strokes at the end of characters, used in news papers
- San-serif font dont have strokes at the end of character,m they’re more playful and modern, used on the web
- Monosapce means single space fonts, every character has the same width. are used for displaying code
- For setting the font-style we have the property called font-family, we can choose a font stack that contain multiple web safe fonts which are available in most computers out there. font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; firstly the browser check if the font Arial is installed in the users browser, if its is installed, its going to apply to the targeted element. Otherwise its going to look at the next font in the stack, which is Helvetica, if this font is not available then it’s going to apply the next font in the stack.
- To set the boldness/ weight of the font we use font-weight property, we have a bunch of numbers from 100 to 900, 100 being really thin and 900 being really thick
- We have font-style property to set the style of the font, the default value is normal.
- We can also change the size of the font using font-size property, we have keywords like large ,larger ans so on. Or we can use an absolute value like 30px or we could use a relative value like 1rem.
- we can also set the color of the font using color property, the default is black hexadecimal #000000

### Web safe Fonts

- Web safe fonts e.g. Arial, Helvetica, Georgia and Times new Roman are available on all computers out there, but they are boring. There are plenty of web sites where i could find beautiful fonts. A popular and free font called Open Sans can be used. We’ll go to www.[fontsquirrel.](http://fontsquirrel.com)com and search for Open Sans. Now font files come in different formats, e.g. TTF, OTF, WOFF. For web we use WOFF. So we download the WOFF file from the website, it’ll be a zip file so we’ll need to unzip it. When we unzip it we’ll find folder named web fonts init we’ll find different folders that contain different opensans styles like bold, extrabold and others. We’ll open a opensans-regular folder and init we’ll find a .woff file that we need to store in our project folder in the CSS folder and then open the stylesheet.css file and copy it’s content to our project’s stylesheet. These stylesheet files contain font-face rules to register a custom font and tell the browser where to find the font files. We have copy these rules at the very top because we need to register these fonts before we can  use them. Now in our style sheet we want to reference the files we copied to the CSS/fonts folder, so we need to append the relative path to these files in src property of the font-face rule.
- To embed a custom font in our web pages we need to use the font-face rule to register that font and then we can use that font like any regular font any where in our style sheet.

 

### Flash of Unstyled Text

- One of the problem with custom fonts is that the user may encounter a flash of unstyled text, what basically means while our browser is downloading custom fonts when it is loading an html file, it’s going to use a fallback font and our text may appear unstyled. So to solve this problem we can use the font-display property to tell the the browser how it should handle this scenario, the default value is auto that allows the browser to decide what should be done, We dont want to use auto as it can hide the text until custom font is downloaded, we can also use swap value, which allows the browser to use a fallback font and swap with the custom font when it’s available.

### Font services

- Embedding font into web pages may require license and the license could be expensive so this where web font services can help the most popular service is google web fonts. Lets learn how to use google web fonts. Head over to google web fonts. On the top we have categories like serif, sans serif, monospace, we want to look for a san serif font so we’ll deselect all other options. Then we choose Open Sans and then we’ll see text in different Open Sans weights from really thin to thicker. We’ll choose a font which we like by clicking the select button on the right. Once we have selected all our fonts, we’ll click the icon on the top right corner and it’ll open up a sidebar. To use these fonts on our page we are going to copy the link elements and paste them in our HTML file before the link to the style sheet, so that they can be loaded before we can use them in our style sheets. Now we’ll go back to our sheet and and replace the custom name “opensans” of our fontsquirrel with “Open Sans” of google fonts.

### System Font Stack

- With this we can tell the browser to use the default font stack of the OS of the user computer. It has certain benefits like it boosts performance, user doesn’t experience a flash of unstyled text, plus our web site looks more famaliar to the user. Different OS user different fonts, so when your using system stack, your font will look different one computer to another. These system fonts are different from web safe fonts, web safe fonts are elementary fonts are available on almost all computers but system fonts are more modern.
- The way to use system font stack is type a dash with the OS name e.g. font-family: -apple-sytem and then choose from the drop down menu.

### Sizing Fonts

- Using the font-size property we can change the size of our font. We can set it to a absolute value e.g. 20px or a relative value. But as a general rule forget about setting font-size with pixels, because pixels are not consistent across devices. E.g. apple allow it macbooks to have smaller pixels to fit more pixels on the screen.
- So for font-size we want to use relative units e.g. %, vx, vh, em and rem. Generally speaking the units for setting font sizes is rem unit.
- When we use rem, we should define a rule for html element, and set the font-size to 62.5% that means 62.5% * 16 = 10px. So if we set the font-size of paragraph or a heading to 1rem that would means 1 * 10px =10px.

### Vertical Spacing

- There are two properties we can use for vertical spacing margin and line-height.
- Now we are going to duplicate our heading1 and paragraph. Now this text is currently violating the law of proximity. Law of proximity describes how we humans see connection between various objects. So objects. So objects that are close together are perceived to be related. so look at the margin above and below the 2nd heading 1. So margins are exactly the same. Not clear if the heading is for the paragraph below. So here we want to apply top margin so that the heading gets separated from the paragraph. And we want to reduce the bottom margin so that the heading is closer to the paragraph below. So in our rule for h1 heading we set the margin property to margin: 5rem 0 0.5 rem. That means we set the top margin to 5rem, right margin to 0 and bottom margin to 0.5 rem and left the left margin for the browser to decide. The reason why we are using rem is because we want the margin to be relative to the font-size of the root element.
- Next property is line-height. It’s used to set the height of our lines. With this property we can adjust the vertical space between the lines. So we could bring the lines closer or farther. General rule is to set this to one and half to the font size

### Horizontal Spacing

- There are three properties for horizontal spacing. letter spacing, word spacing and width.
- lets set the letter spacing to 1rem which is equal to 10px, its to much spacing. So you want to use pixels instead of rem for letter spacing. So lets set tit to 1px.
- Now thing is ideal line length. How many character we must have so that the reader can easily read. It’s between 50 to 70 characters. In our rule for paragraph element we are going to set the width to 50ch, which is relative to the 0 character, so 50 ch is equivalent to 50 0’s.

### Formatting Text

- Properties that we can use for formatting text are text-align, text-indent, text-decoration, text-transform, white-space, column for creating multi column text and direction which is used in languages like persian and hebrew.
- text-align is used for horizontally aligning our text, the default value is left, but we can set it to right. Dont use justify value it makes reading the text harder.
- text-indent is used for adding indentation on the first line of text. e.g. if we set it to 1 rem, there will be 1 rem = 16px of space on the first line. Some times we dont wan to indent the paragraph after the heading, we want to indent the subsequent paragraphs. for this we have to add a p to the rule in the style sheet. e.g. p + p { }. Now the first line of the second paragraph is indented.
- text-decoration we can set it to underline or line-through.
- with text-transform we can convert the lower case or upper case or capitalize, this will capitalize the first letter of the every word.
- with white-space we can control wrapping and if we set it to nowrap, all our paragraph will be on one line, and we have to horizontally scroll. We dont horizontal scrolling so quite often when we want to disable wrapping we want to enforce a limit on paragraph and then truncate the text. To do that firstly lets give a border to our paragraph element, now anything that is outside the border area is overflowing. By default value of overflow property is visible thats why we see overflown content. but if we set it to hidden, now the text is clipped. So to truncate text we need to set the width e.g. width: 50ch, white-space set to nowrap so that we end up with only one line of text, next we set overflow to hidden so that any overflowing text is clipped.
- In CSS3 we have properties for creating multi-column text easily. We can use column-count and set to 2 so we’ll have to columns. We can use column-gap we can set it to 1 rem. We can also add a line between our columns using coulmn-rule: 3px dotter color;.

## Images

### Image type and format

- In computer we have two types of images Raster and Vector images, raster images are made up of pixels and vector images are defined by a set of mathematical vectors like line and curves. We use raster images for photos and vector for graphic.
- Raster images are produced by cameras and scanners but can also be produced by softwares. Raster images have formats like JPG, PNG, GIF, etc and as the  picture gets larger we need more pixels this the image size is larger. On web we don’t want to serve large images because they take time downloading, and dont want to serve small images because they get blurry when we scale them up. Raster images come in another format called webp, they are smaller in size but are not supported by Internet Explorer.
- Vector images can be created by adobe illustrator and have SVQ format. These images are not made up of pixels so they dont get blurry when we scale them up.

### Content Images

- In HTML we have two types of images content images and back ground images.
- image element has two important attributes src and alt. Src is for source of the image and alt if for alternative text. We should not leave out the alt attribute because is for some reason the image couldn’t load the screen reader will read the src text and we dont want screen reader to read the name of the file to a blind person. Leave the alt attribute empty.
- When we load an image of size 400px * 400px. Using CSS we can resize the image to take up 100vw view port width, then the image gets blurry. This the problem with raster images, vector images dont have these issues when we scale them up.

### Back Ground Images

- We can use background images for decorative purposes, e.g. for body element or a header element.
- Lets define a rule for the body element. And set the background property or background-image property. As the value of this property we will type the URL function and provide it with an absolute or relative value.
- When the background images is loaded we can see that the image is repeated horizontally and vertically which is ugly but we have full control over the background image. We can use the property background-repeat and set it to no-repeat. Or we can set it to repeat-x that will repeat the image only along the horizontal direction.
- By default background is placed on the top left corner but we have full control over the position. We can use the background-position property, it takes two value first for the horizontal adjustment and second for the vertical adjustment. So we can push this background image 100px right and 100px down. To push the image 100px to the left we provide it with a negative -100px. Here we are using absolute values but we can also use relative values like %, e.g. if we set the first value to 100% the bg image will move to the right side of the screen.
- We can also set the size of the BG image, using background-size property, it takes two value first is the width and second is for the height. We can provide it with both absolute values and relative values. If we set the height to 100% the image would not be visible because body element is a block level element and the height of block level element is zero, so they get tall enough to fit their content. But if we set the height of the body element to 100vh that is 100% of the view port height, now the bg image stretches to fill the entire container. We set the bg-size to cover, now the bg image will cover the entire page, but it’s a little but blurry.
- Now lets add a heading to the bg image and increase the height to 200vh, now we have scrolling option and our bg image is alot blurry, because our bg-size ppty is set to cover so out browser resized the image so that it cover the entire container.
- Now as we scroll our bc image also moves, here we have a property background-attachment and if we set it to fixed, our bg is going to stay fixed relative to the view port. And now the bg image is smaller because now it’s covering 100% height of the view port not 200. So if you set the bc-attachment to fixed relative to the view port.

### CSS sprites

- It is an optimization technique.
- We use an img element to load an icon from www.[flaticon.com](http://flaticon.com).
- Now if our page contain several images e.g.  three or more, when we open up our page all those images are going to get downloaded by the browser from the server. For each image our browser sends a single https request , if we have tons of images and there are thousands of concurrent users, all these are going to send http request to the server, So that is going to cause overhead on the server. For this we use the optimization technique called CSS sprites. With it we can combine all the images into a single image and get all those images using a single http request. Go to [csssprites.com](http://csssprites.com) upload our images and then generate and download a zip folder. With in the zip folder we have a .png file with all the images combined with no padding between them. We also have a CSS file within the zip folder which has a bunch of rules for classes, all these classes start with bg-, that the prefix we set earlier before generating the css sprite, after bg- we have a name that comes from a file name. e.g. the first file was dishes so it’s bg-dishes. Next we have to copy these rules to out stylesheet and then update their paths.
- So in our markup we are going to remove all the image elements. And instead add a span element with a class of bg-dishes. Now we get the dish icon just like before, but in this case, this icon is applied using a background image. Sp we have a sprite that combines all the images and in our span we are showing only the first one. The display property of the bg-dishes class is set to inline-block, because spans are inline elements and we cannot apply width and height to inlin elements to apply width and height to inline element we change there display property to inline-block.
- Now we are going to use two more span elements with classes bg-landing and bg-rocketship respectively. Now we get all those icons exactly like before but with this new implementation when the page loads the images it only send a single http request to the server instead of three.

### Data URL

- Also known as Data URIs. It is also an optimization technique for reducing the number of HTTP requests. With this technique we can embed an image directly into an HTML document or a style sheet.
- For this demo we are going to go to a website that would generate Data URI which is a long list of characters for the image we are going to take this Data URI and place in the src attribute of our img element. So if we refresh our page we see a rocket ship on the top left. Now this dataURL is coming straight from the memory so our browser didn’t send a separate http request to download image, because this image is embedded within our html document.
- The problem is that the size of the embedded code is larger than the resource or the image itself so we dont want to embed to many URLs.

### Clipping

- Cutting or clipping a part of a image
- search for a css slip generator like bennettfeely.com
- Choose a clip design and then copy the clip-path property below and paste it in your style sheet

### Filters

- We can apply filter to our images using CSS like grey scale, blur contrast, brightness and saturation.
- We can use the filter property and set it grey-scale() and pass an argument like 70%. After grey-scale we can pass another value e.g blur(3px). Now what if we wan to apply the filter when we hover over the image. For that we could use pseudo-class selectors like :hover, :active, :visited. With pseudo class selector we can select an element with a particular class. So here we apply it to our meal class.

### Web p images

- There are many way to convert an image to web p format e.g. photoshop, sketch and an online tool called cloudconvert/jpg-to-webp. After it’s converted we could use that image instead of Jpeg. A web p file is smaller compared to a jpeg about half the size. And this will load the image quicker as it is smaller.

### Font-Icons

- We have another way of displaying icons. These icon fonts are special fonts. Popular ones are Font Awesome, Ionicons and Material Design Icons.
- On font awesome we create our account and get a kit of icons. To use these we have to copy the script element from the page and paste it in our mark up in the head section.
- Then we have to choose an icon and paste the code to our HTML markup. Instead of the i element we could use a span element.

## Forms

### Creating a basic form

- We have a forum element. IT has an action attribute for submitting the forum.
- Inside the Forum we are going to have input fields called forum controls. So we are going to have an input element, each input element is going to have a type, if the type is text, we get a single line text field. We can always style this text field e,g. make the borders round. Now before the input field we want a label, so we use the label element and between the opening and closing tags we can type our label e.g. name. We could have used a paragraph element instead of label but then the text field would have been on the next line because paragraph elements are block level element, but label elements are in-line elements. Every label element has a for attribute with it we can associate it with an input field. So we can give our input field an id e.g. name and then also give it to the label elements for attribute.
- lets create another label and input field for Email, notice the email label and input field appear on the same line as the first label and input field. Some times we want to lay them vertically. For this we can place each label and input field in a separate div.
- after the second div we’ll add a button element, each button has a type attribute and if we use submit as value it will used to submit the form. For the clear button we’ll use the type reset, when we click the clear button that would clear out he form.

### Styling forms

- The form we created above is ugly, lets style it.
- Firstly we go to our style sheet and write a rule for the body element, to use the system font stack.
- then increase the line height to 1.5 that makes the layout more readable.
- Next we want to put the input field below it’s label to do that we can write a rule that makes the label a block level element, that way the label will take up the entire available width. So we’ll set the display property to block. But it’s violating the law of proximity. The Email label is to close to the input field for label name. So we want to add a vertical space around the input groups. What we can do is use the class attribute of our div’s and assign them a class of lets say “form-group”. and define a rule for it in the style sheet that has a margin-bottom property of 1 rem.
- Lets define some styles for our text fields. Firstly we need to define a rule for the input fields, and set the border property to 1px solid grey. next set the border radius to 5 px that’ll make the corner of the text field round, next our text in the text fields appear to be really close to the borders or corners so for that we’ll add some padding.
- Now there is a problem with this implementation. There are many types of text fields, e.g. we have used text type, then there’s email type, but using an input element we can also render a check box or a radio button. And we dont want to define a rule for the input element because we dont want to style all our inputs the same way. We want to apply these only to text fields, so this is where we use an attribute selector, e.g. after the input keyword we type a pair of square brackets [ type = “text”], [type=’email’]
- lets right another rule for input with attribute selector type=’text and pseudo class selector focus e.g. input[type=’text’]:focus {  }. then add a box shadow around the input fields border so it’s more visible. box shadow will be set to 0(horizontal offset) 0(vertical offset) 0(for bluring) 4px(for spreading shadow) rgba(24, 117, 255, 0.25)
- When we click our input field the transition is very quick the box shadow and the border-color appear immediately. But transition in real world are not that quick, so in out rule for normal inputs in the normal state we are going to set the transition property. We want to apply transition to the border color and box shadow. e.g border-radius 0.15s, box-shadow 0.15s that means that theses properties should change in this much time.
- Now lets work on the buttons, write a rule for button and set the background color to blue. Change the font color from black to white. Then we should remove the ugly border, we can get rid of that using border: 0. Now our text is so close to our buttons so we are going to add some padding.
- so this how we can style forms but as we can see we have several types of input fields and defining all these styles for various input fields can sometimes be time consuming. So this is where all of people use CSS Frameworks.

### CSS Frameworks

- Styling fonts can be time consuming so we use css frameworks. A framework is a library of CSS code that we can reuse to build beautiful modern looking websites. The most popular is Bootstrap or milligram.
- Here we will use bootstrap and milligram.
- Head over to bootstrap and download it, over there you’ll find a CDN which is short for content delivery network. These content delivery networks are essentially a bunch of server around the world and these are optimized for delivering web assets like images, CSS files, javascript files and so on. We are going to copy the first link here.
- Now we are going to give this from a modern look. we just have to apply a bunch of classes in our html markup. bootstrap has a bunch of classes for forms e.g. for label its has a class called “form-label” and for form inputs a class called “form-control”.
- As you can see the input fields have taken the entire width of the page so we will apply constraints to the form element. So we define a class for the the form element e.g. class=”50-vw” that means 50 percent of the parent element.
- The labels are too close to the input fields are the second label can be mistaken for the first input field thus law of proximity is being violated. What we need to do is use a class called “mb-3” which means margin bottom 3
- When the page is loaded it downloads some CSS files which take very long e.g. 58ms to download, if a user is on a poor connection they’ll have to wait for it to load.
- this is where we could use a minimalistic framework like milligram. we can load it using a CDN just copt the link and paste in the head section of the html markup. And remove the bootstrap link element. We just need to add this link to our html markup and bam without adding any classes it styles our form perfectly. .

### Text Field

- In this html markup we are going to use milligram CSS framework and a style sheet as well
- There are various kinds of input fields e.g. text when we create an input element it has various attributes e.g. type, there are various types e.g. text, number, date, checkbox, time and others.
- If we want to type multiple lines of text, for that we’ll use a text area element. col represents number of columns or character in a line, which is set to 30 and rows represent number of lines. And we can also resize this text area by toggling the corner of the text area.  and we can stop it from resizing by defining a rule for the text area and by using the property resize: none;
- Input fields have a few important attributes e.g. value (it allows to pre-populate an input field), placeholder (we’ll see it’s value in the input field when it’s empty and once we type that value disappears), readonly value(in this case the user cannot change the input field), disabled value(in this case we cannot select the input field), maxlength (used for validation-the user cant type more than allowed characters)

### Data list

- When we click on a text field we want to see a list of suggestions its also called a data list. Lets learn how to implement it. Under the input element add a data list element, inside the data list element add as many option elements as required. To associate this data list with the above input field, we need to give our data list an id of countries. And in the input field we have add an attribute called list and set it to countries. When we choose a value from the list, we might want to send a numeric value to the server. e.g. on the server we might have a database with a list of countries, with each country having a unique identifier. So when submitting the form we might want to send a unique identifier. So on the server, we know what country the user has selected. Now if we set the value attribute of option element to unique identifier, now we see this value in the suggestion list along the country name, this is ugly what we can do is create our own data attribute and using javascript read this value and submit it to the serve.

### Drop Down List

- To implement it we use the select element, the name attribute is used when we wan to submit a form to the server and the id attribute when we want to associate it with a label.
- Inside the select element we will have option element. Now if we refresh the page we will see a drop down list if we click the drop down field.
- Sometimes when loading a form we want to select an option by default the one user had selected before for this we can add the selected boolean attribute. Now the first option will show by default.
- Sometimes we want to categorize the options in a drop down list. So for this we use the optgroup element and place the option under multiple optgroups. And each group should have a label.

### Check Boxes

- Create an input element, choose type check box, to associate it with a label we need to give it a unique identifier.
- Create a label and set it’s for element to the id assigned in the input element. Now the label appears to be on the next line, because milligram converts the label to a block level element. To put the label in front of the check box we have to use one of the utility classes of milligram called label-inline for the label element. Most of the time we want to wrap these two elements in a div so that we can stack them up vertically.

### Radio Buttons

- With check boxes user can select multiple options but with radio button user can only select one option
- Create an input field, choose type radio button. The name attribute is used for grouping multiple radio buttons. lets give name attribute the value “membership” and id of “silver” then after the input element create a label element and set it for attribute to “silver”.

### Range Selector or Slider

- Sometimes we want to show a user a slider to select a numerical value. create an input element of type range and set the min attribute to 0, max to 100 and initial value to 90. We cannot show the changes in the slider using html and css, to show the change in value we’ll need to use javascript

### File inputs

- In a input field of type file if you want to allow the user to select more than one file.
- There are a couple of attributes you need to remember for the file input field, multiple(for user to select multiple files), accept(with this we can limit the files the user can select e.g. we can use accept = “.jpg” now the user can only select JPG files)

### Grouping related fields

- As our form get bigger and complex we need to group the related fields into logical containers. So this is where we use fieldset element and inside it we need to use legend element, thats the label for our group. now below the legend element we have our input elements. Now our input elements have a field that represents the group of inputs.

### Hidden fields

- for example we have a form for choosing a course, we have input fields like courses, titles and price and so on. At some point we will submit this from to the server. Question is how do we know on the server which course was added. Well each course should have a unique identifier which should have a numerical value, these id get generated by the server, now when displaying this form we want to include the identifier so when submitting to the server we can track which course was added this is where we use hidden fields. So back to our form we create an input of type hidden, give it a name attribute “course-id” and a value like “1234”. now this hidden field is invisible

### Data Validation

- Before submitting a from we should always validate the data, if you have required field you want to make sure they are filled out, email field not just have random characters or numbers, if you have a number field you wan to make sure they are in a valid range e.g. we cannot have a negative value for a price or age. HTML 5 has some basic attributes to do some validation e.g. if we the attribute required and if user doesn’t type something is that field and submits the form, it will show an error message.

### Submitting Forms

- We have a form that has a name and email field and a submit button and set the buttons type to “submit”.
- For submitting there are two attributes, action this is where we are sending the data, so here we give an absolute URL. Whats behind that URL ? This is where server side technologies come into play.
- The second attribute we need to add is method, either its value is “GET” or “POST”. To submit a from every field should have a name attribute. The method is how we want to send the data. If we use the POST method the name attribute values of like “name” and “email” and the values in the input field will be included in the body of the http request. If we use GET method, these fields will not be included in the http

### CSS best practices

- Follow a naming convention, either kabab-case or camalCase or PascalCase
- create logical section in your style sheet
- Avoid over specific selectors

### Variables

- Also called CSS variables also called custom properties to keep our code dry. e.g. we have a color hexadecimal value we are using in multiple classes, we dont want to repeat it everywhere in our code, because if we want to change that color to some other color we’ll have to make changes everywhere, so to solve this issue we have variables or custom properties. What we should do is define a root pseudo class selector :root { }, this selector matches the html element. this is where we can define custom properties or global variables. We start with two hyphens and then give our variable a name e.g.                          —primary-color:#fffssdd; , we can also define another variable for the size of our borders.
- to access that variable we use the var( ) method instead of a value and pass it the name of the variable.
